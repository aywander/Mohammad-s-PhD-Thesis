\section*{Disclaimer}

I hereby declare that the work in this thesis is my original research work. The work was undertaken between February 2010 and September 2014 at the Australian National University, Canberra. It has not been submitted in whole or in part for any other degree at this or any other university. I performed initialisations of  models, analysis and visualisation of the simulated data presented in this thesis. 

$\bf{Chapter\,3:}$ Fig.~\ref{taylor} is generated by using the 6cm VLA data of Hydra A kindly provided by Professor Gregory Taylor. 


$\bf{Chapter\,4:}$ My supervisor, Prof. Geoffrey Bicknell, wrote the argument for the neglect of magnetic field in my simulations (\S~\ref{s:mag}). 

I am grateful to Prof. Geoffrey Bicknell, Dr Alexander Wagner and Shaila Akhter for helping me in English grammer and sentence construction.
