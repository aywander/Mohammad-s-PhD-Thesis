In chapter~\ref{chapter5} I presented the detail study of the Hydra A northern jet focussing two bright knots and the radial oscillation of the central 10~kpc jet. Here I consider the implications of the knot structure in the southern jet. In this case there are \emph{four} knots compared to two in the northern jet and the jet is more curved. Moreover there has been no determination of the jet radius versus distance from the core. Hence, the southern jet data do not provide as good a basis for parameter estimation. Nevertheless, it is of interest to apply the previous approach, which reinforces the velocity estimates for the northern jet. There is one interesting difference in that the optimal model has an initial overpressure ratio of unity. Four bright knots and the locations of the associated reconfinement shocks are shown in Fig.~\ref{southern}.

Guided by the models for the northern jet, I  perform a parameter study for the southern jet on the basis of the same proposition that the four bright knots in the southern jet (see Fig.~\ref{taylor}) are the consequence of four consecutive biconical shocks at 2.5, 3.9, 5.4, and 6.7 kpc. As I  discussed earlier, because of the lack of observational data for the radius profile of the jet within 5 kpc from the core, I  only consider the shock positions of this jet.

We fix the jet power and jet radius to the values of the best-fit model for the northern jet at $P_\mathrm{jet} = 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $r_\mathrm{jet}=100$pc, respectively, and vary only the two other independent jet parameters, the jet velocity and the pressure ratio between the jet and the ambient medium. Because the spacing of the shocks in the southern jet is smaller than that in the northern jet, I explored slightly higher ranges of the jet velocity for a given value of $p_\mathrm{jet}/p_\mathrm{a}$. I  also performed runs with pressure ratios $p_\mathrm{jet}/p_\mathrm{a}=2$ and 1. Simulation parameters for the different models are presented in Table~\ref{t:sim_par_s}.

The parameter $\chi$, which is determined by the other jet parameters through Eqn.~\ref{chi2} becomes negative for jet velocities greater than 0.96, so that this represents the maximum possible jet velocity.  I therefore explored values of  the pressure ratio $p_\mathrm{jet}/p_\mathrm{a} = 2 \rm  \ and \ 1$, keeping the jet velocity fixed at $\beta = 0.8$ (run Eiii, Eiv, Ev, and Evi). The results of different runs are shown in Fig.~\ref{p_s_s}. In this figure the vertical dashed lines represent individual models (labeled by model names) with increasing order from left to right. The overpressure ratio and velocity of each model are presented on the top and bottom axes. The points on each model line represent the shock locations. 

The model with a pressure equilibrium jet and jet (run Ev) produces the required four shocks within the central 7 kpc. To see the dependence of the shock positions on the jet velocity I  ran models with two other jet velocities 0.75 and 0.85. From the comparison of the simulated and observed shock positions I conclude that the best fit model for the southern jet is with jet velocity $\beta = 0.8$. 

Figure~\ref{m_s_p} shows the logarithmic pressure image of the central $2\times8$ kpc domain of the best fit model for the southern jet (run Eiv). This image shows the four consecutive conical shocks marked with 1, 2, 3 and 4.


\section{summary}
\begin{figure*}[ht!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sss.eps}
\caption{Logarithmic pressure image for an over-pressured jet (run Ei, left panel) and a pressure equilibrium jet (run Ev, right panel) imposed with the flow velocity. The flow velocity is appears converging at the reflected shock zone in the case of over-pressured jet and to be diverging in the case of pressure equilibrium jet. In the pressure equilibrium case the difference in the expansion rate of the jet in the outer and inner part of the reflected shock zone (marked by the pentangle) cause an extra biconical shock in the reflected shock domain.}

\end{figure*}

The axisymmetric models with pressure equilibrium jets produce four bright knots within 8~kpc. This result is consistent with the number of shocks and their locations of the southern jet of Hydra A. A visual comparison of the shock locations between the simulations and the observations shows the the best fit model of the southern jet is with $p_{\rm jet}/p_{\rm a} =1$ and $\beta = 0.8$. Therefore, axisymmetric models of the northern and southern jets based on the knot location (for both cases) and radial oscillation (only for the northern jet) provide a consistent jet velocity for the Hydra A jets. 

I now compare in more detail the flow structure of an over-pressured jet with that of a pressure-equilibrium jet, and describe why in the former case we see two knots and in the latter case four knots. In Fig.~\ref{s_s}, the flow pattern of the over-pressured jet (left panel, run Ei) and the pressure equilibrium jet (right panel, run Ev) overlayed on the pressure image is shown in Fig.~\ref{s_s}. Here we see that an over-pressured jet expands more and the inclination of the incident reconfinement shock is larger than in the case of a pressure equilibrium jet. Hence, In the pressure equilibrium case, the flow is diverging (see right panel of Fig.~\ref{s_s}) at the shocked zone (marked by pentangle). The diverging flow causes rapid expansion, which is counteracted by the formation of another reconfinement shock. Therefore, in the pressure equilibrium case, we have knots in the intermediate spaces of the knot locations of the over-pressured jet and have twice the number of shocks in the pressure equilibrium jet. 

One concern with the modelling of the southern jet is that the observational data is noisy and not well-resolve. It is also possible that the first knot is an observational artefact. Therefore, in the next stage of my study of Hydra A jets with three dimensional models I focus on the northern jet. 



%Therefore when the flow crosses the incident shock it bends more towards the jet axis in the case of over-pressured jet. The flow further changes direction when crossing the reflected shock and in the over-pressured jet the more inclined flow produces a converging zone beyond the reflected shock while in the pressure equilibrium jet we see a diverging zone. Beyond the reflected shock the over-pressured jet expands uniformly and repeat the production of the next biconical shock. However in the pressure equilibrium scenario the jet expands very rapidly within the central part of the reflected shock domain (marked by the white pentangle). The high pressure in the edge of the reflected shock quickly reconfine the inner low pressured jet by an incident shock. Therefore we obtain twice the number of shocks in the pressure equilibrium jet.
