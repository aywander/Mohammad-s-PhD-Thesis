%\section{A verification of the axisymmetric model: naked jet}
The simulations of jets propagating into the cluster atmosphere conducted in the previous two chapters typically evolve for 50 kpc, which is the extent of the simulation domain, over a timescale of approximately 20~Myr. While the shock structures in the jet, the turbulent transition of the jet, and global structures, e.g. the turbulent backflows in the cocoon and forward shock of the bubble, are well captured, the simulation time is less than the age of the source. It is possible therefore that the jet is being affected by the backflow within this restricted domain. The purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to ascertain whether the shock positions seen in the simulations are unaffected by the back flow form the head of the jet. To this end I look at the evolution of the shock positions with time, and also perform a simulation of an unbounded jet -- a jet spanning the entire domain and not bounded by a termination shock. This is more representative of conditions in the inner regions of an evolved radio source, such as that of Hydra A.

The shock positions are almost time-independent as the jet expands and reconfines multiple times before escaping through the top boundary. No transition to turbulent flow is observed. The right panel is a closeup of the central region marked with a box in the left panel. In both panels the scales are in kpc.}

Figure~\ref{f:c_vs_n} shows the evolution of the first (circles) and second (crosses) shock positions for model Cv, respectively, as a function of time. The shock positions increase with time, but appear to asymptote to values very close to 3 and 6 kpc, respectively.

In the simulation of an unbounded jet, I set up the the jet inlet with the same jet parameters and geometry as in run Cv, but I also initiate the full extent of a jet column spanning the length of the domain along the jet axis at the start of the simulation. Since the jet is initially overpressured, it expands and contracts, sending a nearly axisymmetric shock wave into the ambient medium, and forming reconfinement shocks along the jet axis. Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities develop in the shear layer between the jet and the ambient medium, but other than that and the initial adjustment, the flow in the entire simulation box is broadly time-independent. Without a jet backflow, a turbulent cocoon does not develop. Simulations of unbounded jet allow us to measure the quasi-steady reconfinement shock positions because, in the absence of a turbulent cocoon, the global structure of the flow in the simulation domain and the pressure field of the medium surrounding the jet remain fairly steady.

Figure~\ref{f:u_jet} shows the features developed by an unbounded jet model at time $t=19$ Myr. The right panel shows a closeup of the in central $5\times20$ kpc region. The jet is embedded in a relatively steady ambient medium exhibits the first two reconfinement shocks at 3 and 6 kpc. This result is also shown in Fig.~\ref{f:c_vs_n} with two horizontal lines. These shock locations agree with the asymptotic values of the shock position in run Ciii. 

Simulations of unbounded jets are useful for accurately measuring nearly time-independent positions of shocks in a jet, provided the top outflowing boundary is not affecting the structure of the jet. However, these models are not useful in explaining other important features of the Hydra A northern jet, in particular, the turbulent transition of the jet and the formation of the plume structure. As we see in the unbounded jet simulation the deceleration through the biconical shocks and the entrainment in the shear layer alone can not produce the turbulent transition. The ram pressure of the turbulent back flow in the cocoon plays an important role in further deceleration and disruption of the jet, which we see in the simulations of an evolving jet, in which the jet is surrounded by a cocoon of entrained plasma.
